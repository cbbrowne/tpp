tpp - text presentation program
===============================

What is tpp?
------------

tpp stands for text presentation program and is an ncurses-based
presentation tool. The presentation can be written with your favorite
editor in a simple description format and then shown on any text
terminal that is supported by ncurses - ranging from an old VT100 to the
Linux framebuffer to an xterm.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites: 
  * Ruby 1.8 <http://www.ruby-lang.org/>
  * a recent version of ncurses
  * ncurses-ruby <http://ncurses-ruby.berlios.de/>

Optionally:
  * FIGlet (if you want to have huge text printed)

Installing tpp:

  Just copy tpp.rb to your favorite location, e.g. ~/bin or
  /usr/local/bin.


Using tpp
---------


Start tpp with the presentation file you would like to display:

$ tpp presentation.tpp


To control tpp, the following keys are available:

space bar .............................. display next entry within page
space bar, cursor-down, cursor-right ... display next page
b, cursor-up, cursor-left .............. display previous page
q, Q ................................... quit tpp
j, J ................................... jump directly to page
s, S ................................... jump to the start page
e, E ................................... jump to the last page
c, C ................................... start command line

On the lower left side of your terminal you will notice the current slide
number and the total number of slides. Left of that, a '*' will appear when
pressing space bar the next time would show the next slide. If no '*' appears,
pressing space bar the next time will show the next entry on the page
(separated by '---').

Writing tpp presentations
-------------------------

The tpp presentation formats consists of normal text lines and special
commands. Special commands are contained in lines that begin with "--"
and the command name.

The presentation is divided into 1 or more pages, which are separated by
the "--newpage". Before the first "--newpage" is encountered, all
non-command text is used as the presentation's abstract. Here, the
title, the author and the date can be set, too. You can also optionally
specify a name for a page, which append it to the "--newpage" command,
separated by a single blank. If no name is set, a name will be
automatically generated.

The following commands are allowed in the abstract page:

--author: sets the author of the presentation

--title: sets the title of the presentation

--date: sets the date of the presentation. If the date is "today", today's
    date is inserted instead.

--bgcolor <color>: the background color is set to <color>.

--fgcolor <color>: the foreground color is set to <color>.

Valid colors are white, yellow, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, black.

Within a page, so-called "page-local" commands can be used. The
following page-local commands are available:

--heading <heading>: draw a heading. Headings will be centered and drawn
    in bold (if supported by the terminal).

--color <color>: draw the text with specified color until a new color is set

--center <text>: center <text>. The text will be drawn centered.

--right <text>: draw <text> right-oriented. When drawing the text, it
    will be aligned on the right side of the terminal.

---: stop drawing until space bar has been pressed.

--beginoutput: marks the beginning of a framed output

--endoutput: marks the end of a framed output

--beginshelloutput: marks the beginning of a framed shell output. The
    difference between normal output and shell output is that lines that
    start with $ are printed as if they were typed by a person.

--endshelloutput: marks the end of a shell output

--sleep <seconds>: tpp stops for 3 seconds, doing nothing and accepting
    no input.
    
--boldon: switches on bold printing
--boldoff: switches off bold printing

--revon: switches on reverse printing (i.e. reverse fg and bg colors)
--revoff: switches off reverse printing

--ulon: switches on underlined printing
--uloff: switches off underlined printing

--huge <text>: <text> is drawn in huge letters. FIGlet is used to
    generate the huge letters.

--exec <cmd>: executes <cmd>. Useful for e.g. starting image viewers.

--beginslideleft: starts the "slide in from left" mode
--endslideleft: ends the "slide in from left" mode

--beginslideright: starts the "slide in from right" mode
--endslideright: ends the "slide in from right" mode

--beginslidetop: starts the "slide in from the top" mode
--endslidetop: ends the "slide in from the top" mode

--withborder: makes a border around the current page

--beginslidebottom: starts the "slide in from the bottom" mode
--endslidebottom: ends the "slide in from the bottom" mode
